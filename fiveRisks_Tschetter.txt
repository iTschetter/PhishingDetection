1. One, some, or all of us do not have the required experience with a certain technology or language required for the project, 75% chance, 1-2 day loss

2. We spend too much time on the fuzzy front end due to our inexperience, 30% chance, 1 day loss

3. We fail to identify all the requirements and features before beginning construction, 10% chance, 1-2 day loss

4. Unfamiliar areas of the software project take more time than expected to design and construct, 25% chance, 2-3 days

5. Necessary functions for the algorithm are not supported by any code libraries, requiring us to build it from the ground up, 25% chance, 4-5 days
