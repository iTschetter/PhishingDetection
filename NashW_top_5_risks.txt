1.  Requirements have been baselined but continue to change 

        Communicate with SBS to determine specifications. 

2.  Personnel need extra time to learn unfamiliar software tools or environment 

        Develop a basic add-on that communicates with an API as a proof of concept. 

3.  Customer communication time (e.g., time to answer requirements-clarification 

    questions) is slower than expected 

        Establish regular communication channel with SBS and keep them informed of our progress. Be proactive 

4.  Development of extra software functions that are not required (gold-plating) 

    extends the schedule 

        Work on minimum viable product before implementing gold-plating 

5.  Requirements for interfacing with other systems, other complex systems, or other 

    systems that are not under the teamâ€™s control result in unforeseen design, 

    implementation, and testing
